General

This 'play' directory is just for experimenting.

A lot of the examples in here are from...
    https://www.javascripttutorial.net



Browser-sync
------------
I have set up an alias so all you have to do is...
brows fileName.html.

If you don't supply a fileName then browser-sync will serve
the index.html file.
